# AngPortfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

## Description

I created this portfolio base as my final assignment for Frontend Developement course using Angular.
No bootsrap or frameworks were used to create this, but I shall be updating the site over time since I
was able to create nice baseline for everything that I need.

Although some code changes are possible, this work shows my present understanding on Frontend Dev.
