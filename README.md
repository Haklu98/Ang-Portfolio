# AngPortfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

## Description

I created this portfolio base as my final assignment for Frontend Developement course using Angular.
No bootsrap or frameworks were used to create this, but I shall be updating the site over time since I
was able to create nice baseline for everything that I need.

The focus was mainly on creating the services for information and in the future I might add personal backend for the site which I can update as I gain more credits and certificates.

Although some code changes are possible, this work shows my present understanding on Frontend Dev.

## Used languages

TypeScript, HTML, CSS
